# Explorer - A theme for Omarchy 

Explorer is a personal theme based on a combination of several themes that are pre-installed in Omarchy.

This project should not be taken seriously - this repository is mainly a backup of the used config.
You're free to use it if you'd like, but beware that some stuff may not be completed since I'm a new guy here, so it's also an exploration (he-he) for me.
Explorer is minimalistic, dark and high-contrast. Everything is legible (at least on my Xiaomi 30" Curved Gaming Panel).
